# Fairy-Navi
A processing 3D animated Navi I made for fun ʚ(╹ᴗ╹)ɞ★ <br />
The main class is Navi.pde, and the rest of the classes are pretty self-explanatory. <br />
One-dimensional Perlin noise was used to simulate Navi's flying. <br />
Modifying the value with which 'f' is initialized in Navi.pde will effectivelly change Navi's size.
