# Fairy
### A processing 3D animated fairy I made for fun ʚ(╹ᴗ╹)ɞ★ <br />
The main class is Main.pde, and the rest of the classes are pretty self-explanatory. <br />
One-dimensional Perlin noise was used to simulate the fairy's flying. <br />
Modifying the value with which *f* is initialized in Main.pde will effectivelly change the fairy's size.
